# ClipVault Login Fix Guide

## ✅ Working Login Methods

### Option 1: Use Demo Button (Recommended)
1. Click the green "Continue with Demo" button
2. This automatically logs you in with test credentials

### Option 2: Manual Login
Use these exact credentials:
- **Email**: `test@test.com`
- **Password**: `password123`

OR

- **Email**: `demo@clipvault.com`  
- **Password**: `demo123`

## 🔧 Current Issue
The screenshot shows you entered `demo@clipvault.com` which should work. If it's not working, try:

1. **Clear the browser cache/localStorage**:
   - Open browser console (F12)
   - Run: `localStorage.clear(); location.reload();`

2. **Use the demo button** instead of typing credentials

3. **Check the browser console** for any error messages

## 🌐 Backend Status
- ✅ Backend running on http://localhost:8001
- ✅ Login endpoint working  
- ✅ JWT tokens being generated
- ✅ Demo credentials configured

## 🚀 Next Steps
1. Try the "Continue with Demo" button (green button)
2. If that doesn't work, check browser console for errors
3. Make sure both frontend (5175) and backend (8001) are running

The authentication is working on the backend - this appears to be a frontend form submission issue.
